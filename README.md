# BlackJack-v2
My second try to made BlackJack, this version compared to v1 is more extensive (you can start new game without reloading page).<br/>
I created this game as a task from part of course on udemy (course about OPP in JavaScript).

## About project
There are two ways to play in this game:
* player vs player,
* player vs AI - I only created one function to handle AI

<br/><br/>
Round - to win round player must score 21 points or have more points than opponent (if everyone has less than 21 points)
<br/>
Win game - to win game player (or AI) need to lead opponent to bankruptcy.


## Technologies
I used in this project: 
* JavaScript (OPP),
* Sass,
* HTML,
* some GSAP (to create input and output animations).

<br/>
status of project: finished.
